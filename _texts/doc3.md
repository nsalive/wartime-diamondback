During one of the coldest nights this year, 
the ROTC held war games in the hills behind
the dairy buildings Wednesday night from 7 ’til 11.

Selected sections carried out the
lessons learned in military classes
this quarter. Those classes which
took up the theories of scouting and
patrolling figured most prominently
In the maneuvers, acting as the at­
tacking force.
The problem consisted of two com­
panies and a section of tanks. The
attacking company, composed of
about 125 men under the leadership
of Bill Gordon, had the assignment
of infiltrating through the defense
outposts, commanded by George Kle­
fter, and bring back information con­
cerning the strength of the defense.
Theoretically, there were three com­
panies in bivouac being protected by
the defense outposts. In order to
accomplish this mission of inflltra­
ttlon, It was necessary for the at­
tackers to crawl and creep across
open stretches of fields where the
flares sent up by the defense could
show the slightest movement and
give the position away. Lts. Morgan
and Waddell, who acted as judges,
were pleased that very few of the
attackers were seen and only a
small percentage were eliminated as
wounded.
The attack started with the tanks
from Fort Meade passing through
the advancing column of men on the
route to the objective. These tanks
had been held as a surprise until the
moment when they appeared, but not
a man failed to do the right thing
when the noise made by them was
heard.
Following the arrival of the tanks
a general attack on the defense posi­
tions started. S/sgt. Max Moses re­
leased a steady barrage of para­
chute flares and bombs which at
times caused the miniature battle­
field to appear as bright as day. The
problem ceased at approximately
10:30 p.m., when all of the advance
column had accomplished their infil­
tration.
The cold kept this maneuver from
being well attended by spectators.
As it was, only a few were present.
The less hardy souls remained in
their warm rooms and were the envy
of almost everyone on the field. The
cold also caused some rather unusual
things to occur. The water in the
Browning machine guns froze solid,
and it was impossible to thaw it out
sufficiently to fire them. Even the
oil in several of the rifles became
so viscous that they were worked
only with the greatest difficulty.
